# Static-Wave-Analysis-API-RP-2A-WSD-2000-ED21
This Library allows users to model forces acting on a cylinderical bottom mounted offshore structure. It has the following utilitiies:
- Wave Field Meshing
- Wave Field Modeling
- Calcuation of forces acting on the structure

The following conditions must be fulfilled to ensure accuracy of results:
- Unidirectional waves (Multi-Directional waves will be catered for in the upcoming patches)
- Deep Water Wave Conditions
- Small Body Assumption to ensure Morisson's Equations hold true.
